Hi there 👋
Hi, I’m Serkan Iazurlo

Autodidact AI Developer • Cybersecurity • Applied AI Systems
Creator of GhostVenumAI

🚀 About Me

I am a self-taught AI and security developer with 8 years of hands-on IT experience, focused on
AI-augmented cybersecurity, automated analysis workflows, and high-efficiency problem solving.

I built my flagship project GhostVenumAI — an open, AI-assisted security analysis engine — independently in just 3 months.
The project combines:

automated network discovery and analysis

AI-assisted vulnerability interpretation

structured, rule-based decision workflows

a clean, modular security-oriented architecture

My goal is to build systems that analyze, reason, and support human decision-making, not systems that act without control.

🧠 What I Work On
🔹 GhostVenumAI (AI-Assisted Security Analysis)

AI-supported network analysis, vulnerability interpretation, and responsible open-source security tooling with clear safety boundaries.

🔹 GhostMirror (AI Traffic Analysis – in development)

A Wireshark-inspired concept that uses AI to explain unusual network traffic patterns in human-readable language.

🔹 GhostShield (AI Risk & Malware Classification – in development)

Heuristic- and AI-assisted classification of suspicious files and behaviors for defensive analysis.

🔹 GhostPoster (AI-Driven Marketing Automation)

AI-assisted generation and structuring of cross-platform content with reproducible logic.

All public repositories contain portfolio-safe demo versions intended for review and recruitment.
More advanced internal prototypes exist but are intentionally not published.

🎯 What Drives Me

I enjoy building systems that combine:

security analysis

AI-assisted reasoning

automation with clear control boundaries

maintainable, self-improving architectures

My approach is hands-on, adaptive, and iterative — I learn by building real systems, not by theory alone.
