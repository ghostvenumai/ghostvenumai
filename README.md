## Hi there 👋

# 👋 Hi, I'm Serkan Iazurlo  
Autodidact AI Developer • Cybersecurity • Autonomous Systems  
Creator of **GhostVenumAI**

## 🚀 About Me

I am a self-taught AI and security developer with 8 years of IT experience and a strong focus on  
**AI-augmented cybersecurity, autonomous reasoning systems, and high-efficiency problem solving**.

I built my flagship project **GhostVenumAI** — an open AI-powered security engine — completely  
independently in **only 3 months**, combining:

- automated network analysis  
- AI-based vulnerability reasoning  
- autonomous decision logic  
- multi-module security architecture  

My goal is to create systems that *think, analyze and support humans*, not just execute instructions.

## 🧠 What I Work On

### 🔹 **GhostVenumAI** (AI Security Engine)
AI-assisted vulnerability analysis, recon automation, intelligent reasoning, and open-source security tooling.

### 🔹 **GhostMirror** (AI Traffic Analysis – in development)
A Wireshark-inspired concept that uses AI to explain unusual traffic patterns in human language.

### 🔹 **GhostShield** (AI Malware/Risk Classification – in development)
Heuristic and AI-driven classification of suspicious files and behaviours.

### 🔹 **GhostPoster** (AI Marketing Automation)
Automatically generates and structures cross-platform posts using AI logic.

All public versions here are **safe demo versions** created for portfolio and recruitment review —  
the private versions contain more advanced logic and autonomous systems.

## 🎯 What Drives Me

I love building systems that combine:

- **security analysis**  
- **AI reasoning**  
- **automation**  
- **self-improving logic**  

My approach is fast, adaptive and experimental — I learn by building real systems, not theory.

## 📝 Note for Recruiters (including OpenAI)

This GitHub profile contains **portfolio-safe demo versions** of my work.  
The real systems are more complex and remain private for security reasons.

I am always open for:

- AI safety engineering  
- AI-augmented security development  
- autonomous system design  
- reasoning systems  
- rapid prototyping
